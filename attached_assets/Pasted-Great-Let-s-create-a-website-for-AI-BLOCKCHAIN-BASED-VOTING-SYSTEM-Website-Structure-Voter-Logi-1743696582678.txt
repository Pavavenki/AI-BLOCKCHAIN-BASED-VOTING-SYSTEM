Great! Let's create a website for AI & BLOCKCHAIN BASED VOTING SYSTEM.

Website Structure
Voter Login Page

This is the initial page where voters will enter their credentials to log in. It will require the voter to input their unique voter ID and password.
Personal Details Verification Page

After successful login, this page will display the voter's personal details for verification. The details include:
Voter ID
Name
Date of Birth
Age
Email ID
Gender
Address
State
District
Pincode
Marital Status
Aadhar Number
The voter must confirm that all details are correct before proceeding. If any details are incorrect, the voter can request assistance.
Biometric Verification Page

Once personal details are verified, this page will prompt the voter for biometric verification. It will include:
Aadhar Number Input: The voter must enter their Aadhar number.
Camera Interface: A live camera feed will appear for the voter to capture their image. This image will be compared with the photo uploaded by the admin during registration.
Fingerprint Scanner Interface: A fingerprint scanner will be available for the voter to scan their fingerprint, which will be compared with the fingerprint data stored during registration.
If both biometric verifications match, the voting page will open.
Voting Page

This page will display the candidates and their respective parties. The voter's personal details will already be filled in, and they will need to tick a checkbox to confirm their identity before proceeding to vote.
Admin Panel

Candidates Page: Admin can add a new candidate by entering:
S.No
Party Name
Party Logo
Candidate Name
Action buttons (Add, Delete, Edit)
Voter Registration Page: Admin can manage voter details, including:
Voter ID
Aadhar Number
Name
All personal details
Action buttons (Add, Edit, Delete)
Results Page: This page will display:
The winning candidate's name
Their party name
Party logo
Number of votes received
Constituency
The second highest vote-winning candidate
This page will essentially serve as a leaderboard for the election results.
